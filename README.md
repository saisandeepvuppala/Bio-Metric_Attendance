In this project, one can customize the feature of bio-metric attendance.

The Technology stack which was used are HTML,CSS,JavaScript,JQuery,MySql,PHP.

Some of the features which are in  biometric attendance are                                                                               ->Accountant can calculate the salary of an employee by checking the no.of days he/she present. 		                                       ->It calculates the DELAY (LATE) of an employee by checking with INTIME and OUTIME through which accountant can cut off their salaries if they crosses the limit.
->It will track the no.of days present by an employee.
->Manager can easily generate the graph with X-axis as employee names and y-axis as no.of days present in a month.
->Teacher(Employee) can take the leave by updating the reason in the file. After updating the reason ,the HOD's will have aaccess to approve or reject the application.

I haven't devloped the admin panel i.e one can delete or update the employee number. I need to add some more features like updating the no. of days in a month autimatically. At present , one need to change the no.of days in PHP file.
soon i will add it.

To execute this project one needs to have a file which will generated using bio-metric machine.It generates a  ".dat" file. with the help of employee.csv , we need to compare the details in both the files and need to generate a final table view in the browser.

In order to execute it, use server(APACHE) and copy the files in htdocs of the apache folder and now open the browser and execute the necessary feature.

Few files are repeated with some extra letters, those are enhanced onces.
